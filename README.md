## I Want To Use Source Control
This template is set up to easily make your own GitHub projects, and we highly recommend you take this route.

</summary>

## 1. Make Your Own GitHub Project

Press [![Use This Template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/737888/185467681-e5fdb099-d99f-454b-8d9e-0760e5a6e588.png)](https://github.com/vrchat-community/template-world/generate)
to start a new GitHub project, and follow the directions there. This is an optional step but gets you started with using GitHub for source control so you'll always have a backup.

## 2. Clone or Download the Project

If you're not ready to use git yet, you can download a zip of your project by pressing the "Code" button and then "Download Zip".

If you're familiar with git, use your favorite client or the command line to clone your repository.

Once the scene opens, choose "File > Save As..." and give the scene a new name.

Then modify the scene however you'd like - you learn about all the examples in [the UdonExampleScene](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/udon-example-scene) or learn about [Getting Started with Udon](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/getting-started-with-udon).
